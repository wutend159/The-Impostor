# The-Impostor

Welcome to **The Impostor**, a simple web-based game where players try to figure out who the impostor is! One player is the Game Master, and the rest are either regular players or impostors. The Game Master provides a word, and players must guess who doesnâ€™t know the word (the impostor).
